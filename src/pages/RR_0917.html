          <p>Warning notices have been received for applications with non-compliant biosketches, so we want to remind all investigators of these requirements as NIH has the option of withdrawing an application during the receipt, referral and review processes without issuing a warning notice.</p>

            <p>BU manages its facilities as efficiently as possible to keep animal housing rates affordable. We annually review costs and charges to Principal Investigators (PIs) who use our Animal Science Center (ASC) to establish competitive rates while remaining fiscally responsible.</p>

          <h5>Get up to speed on new NIH requirements regarding clinical trials.</h5>
          <p>Earlier this year, the National Institutes of Health implemented two new requirements for clinical trials. These requirements are related to registering clinical trials on clinicaltrials.gov and good clinical practice (GCP) training. In order to address these new requirements, the Charles River Campus IRB has revised the IRB forms to include sections for clinical trials registration and good clinical practice training in addition to developing processes to meet these requirements.</p>

          <h5>CTSI launches new two-step application process for pilot grants.</h5>
          <p>BU’s Clinical & Translational Science Institute is launching a new, two-step process for its Integrated Pilot Grant Program, which funds innovative translational research findings and methods. The program will now require investigators to file pre-applications, which are open to faculty at both the Charles River and Medical Campuses and due by 5 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 15. Full applications will then be invitation-based.</p>
          <p class="item-last">Additionally, the grant program now accepts pre-applications from investigators unaffiliated with an Affinity Research Collaborative <strong>(ARC)</strong> for projects that either facilitate entry into an existing ARC or facilitate the establishment of a new one. Visit the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/ctsi/support-for-research/pilot-awards/" target="_blank">CTSI website</a> for more information.</p>

            <h5>Increasing access to nanotechnology</h5>
            <p>This summer, the BU Photonics Center welcomed 12 National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Teachers and 13 NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) to the BU campus.</p>
            <p>Both groups conducted nanotechnology research in Photonics labs. The teachers came from local middle- and high schools where they teach science and engineering classes. The undergraduates traveled from across the country to further explore their interest in STEM.</p>
            <p>This summer marks the third year of the programs, which have yielded a total 34 teachers and 36 undergraduate students at BU. Both programs have focused on increasing access to STEM disciplines: women accounted for 67 percent of the undergraduate participants while 73 percent were underrepresented minorities. The same has been true for the teacher participants, with 74 percent of the participating schools reporting a majority of economically disadvantaged high school students and a majority&mdash;79 percent&mdash;having more than 50 percent minority student enrollment.</p>

            <p>Facilities & Administrative (F&A) costs for sponsored research, which are charged on research grants, are critical to the University’s research infrastructure. When faculty request appropriate F&A costs in their proposals, they ensure the University gets the support it needs to continue advancing BU’s research mission.</p>
            <p class="item-last">Head over to the Research Support website, where you can get a short overview on how the rate is determined and see some <a href="https://goo.gl/2RmQhB">interactive charts</a> that break down what is included under Administrative Costs.</p>
